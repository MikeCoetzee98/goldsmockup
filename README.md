Mockup Application of Golds Gym made to display my learnings in Flutter, not for commercial use. 

Currently in Android development.

Code in Master Branch. 

Tested on Pixel 2 XL, Nexus 5 and Samsung Galaxy s9.
(API 28+)

TO DO:

- Authentication and Tokens

- Product filtering by category + price.

- Search bar functionality.

- Develop for IOS.


To use the map you will need a GoogleMaps Api key in the following places:
For Android (android->app->src->main->AndroidManifest.xml). 
For IOS (once completed) (ios->runner->AppDelegate.swift)
